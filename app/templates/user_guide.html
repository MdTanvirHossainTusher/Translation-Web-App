                <ul>
                    <li>All speech processing happens on your device before being sent for translation.</li>
                    <li>Translations are processed securely and not stored permanently.</li>
                    <li>No patient identifiable information should be included in the conversations.</li>
                    <li>This tool is not a substitute for HIPAA-compliant translation services in settings requiring such compliance.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Microphone not working:</strong>
                        <p>Ensure you've granted microphone permissions to your browser and that your device's microphone is functioning correctly.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Translation not appearing:</strong>
                        <p>Check your internet connection, as translation requires online access. Try stopping and restarting the recording.</p>
                    </li>

                        <strong>Audio playback not working:</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li>While the translator is designed to handle medical terminology, it may not perfectly translate highly specialized terms.</li>
                    <li>The accuracy of speech recognition varies based on accent, speech clarity, and background noise.</li>
                    <li>This tool should be used as an aid to communication, not as the sole means of conveying critical medical information.</li>
